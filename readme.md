# Zero Downtime Presentation

This is a repository for my Architecting Zero Downtime presentation.

There are two main sections of the repo: the client and SQL Code.

## DB Client
This location contains a Visual Studio 2019 project that builds a thick client you can use to connect to a SQL Server instance and continuously run a workload. This workload matches up with the code from the SQL folder.
